                <p>I am a developer and musician based in Apex, North Carolina. I approach all of my work with an emphasis towards precision and craftsmanship. I draw inspiration from the simple, uncomplicated things in life, thought I constantly strive to take complex designs and implement them in ways that are intutitive to users. I strive to design and style the web in ways that are time-tested and true.</p>
                <p>Having been a musician for most of my life, I am drawn to all types of creative endeavors. In creating music, the goal of "perfection" is empirically unattainable, but must always be that for which one strives. I relish the process, and I make it the focus of what I do, and I trust that the outcomes will ultimately be satisfying, time and again.</p>
                <p>I live with my wife, a communications specialist and opera singer, as well as our two cats Basil and Rosemary. I enjoy golf (yes, even on television) and spend my free time contemplating/quantifying the influence of strokes gained statistics on the PGA Tour. I am also drawn to the world of food science--I enjoy cooking and grilling as well as the science of beer. I have sung in choirs and vocal groups my entire life, and I know more song lyrics than any one human being should.</p>
